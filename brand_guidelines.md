Jay Life Brand Guidelines
Version 1.1 | January 2026

1. Brand Overview
Who We Are
Jay Life is a Gen-Z direct-to-consumer wellness brand offering modular, science-backed daily optimization tools. We operate with pharma-grade backend compliance (Jay Life Pharma) but present an entirely independent, internet-native frontend identity.

Brand Promise
"Small upgrades compound."

We don't overhaul lives. We upgrade them—one step at a time.

Strategic Position
For Gen-Z optimizers who want to feel noticeably better without medical anxiety, Jay Life is the daily wellness brand that offers modular, science-backed rituals. Unlike traditional pharma that treats sickness, we upgrade daily life.

2. Brand Architecture
The Brand Firewall
Layer	Identity	Role
Backend	Jay Life Pharma	Supply chain, compliance, credibility
Frontend	Jay Life (D2C)	Brand voice, aesthetics, customer relationship
The backend is boring, safe, massive scale. The frontend is internet-native, aesthetic, human.

Product Architecture
Modular systems—no one-size-fits-all multivitamins:

Product	Purpose	Key Copy
FOCUS	Caffeine + L-Theanine + Tyrosine	"Brain online."
CALM	Ashwagandha + Magnesium	"System offline."
GUT	Probiotics + Digestive Enzymes	"Clean processing."
GLOW	Collagen + Biotin	"Upgrade visible."
MOVE	Recovery compounds	"Rebuild faster."
