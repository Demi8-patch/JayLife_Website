## 🎓 SIMPLE EXPLANATION (For Non-Programmers)

### The Problem

Your website is like a restaurant with **two different kitchens**:

- **Kitchen A** (Homepage): Modern, colorful, efficient
- **Kitchen B** (Product pages): Brutalist art installation, moody, atmospheric

When customers walk from the homepage to product pages, they're shocked by the sudden change. **Very confusing!**

### The Solution

**Use only Kitchen B** throughout the restaurant. It's more complete and consistent.

### How Ralph Wiggum Technique Helps

Think of it like **teaching a smart assistant to debug code**:

1. **OBSERVE:** "I see two design systems"
2. **DIAGNOSE:** "Homepage uses different colors than product pages"
3. **HYPOTHESIZE:** "If I unify the colors, navigation will feel seamless"
4. **TEST:** "Let me test each component after changing"
5. **REFINE:** "Oh, I broke component X, let me fix that"
6. **REPEAT:** "Loop back and test everything again"

This loop is **automatic** with AI — you just verify the fixes.

## 🎓 METHODOLOGY REFERENCE

### Ralph Wiggum Technique

**Source:** Wall Street Journal (2026-01-09)  
"The Ralph Wiggum Technique: How AI is Transforming Software Debugging"

**Core Concept:** Use AI assistants to iterate rapidly through observe-diagnose-test loops, treating code like a doctor treats symptoms:

1. Look at what's broken
2. Find the root cause
3. Propose a fix
4. Test it
5. Refine based on results
6. Repeat until fixed

**Why It Works:**

- AI can process vast amounts of code quickly
- Humans verify safety of each change
- Reversible steps (roll back if needed)
- Fast iteration cycles
- Learns from each attempt
